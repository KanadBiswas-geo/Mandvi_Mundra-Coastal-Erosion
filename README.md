# Mandvi_Mundra-Coastal-Erosion
A remote sensing and GIS-based analysis of shoreline change and climatic influence in Mandvi and Mundra talukas, Gujarat (1994–2024).
This project investigates shoreline changes in the coastal talukas of Mandvi and Mundra, Kachchh district, Gujarat, over a 30-year period (1994–2024) by using satellite images (Landsat 5,7,8), GIS-based shoreline extraction methods like MNDWI, GIS applications like QGIS, DSAS and climatic parameters (Sea Surface Temperature, atmospheric CO₂ levels and sunspot number). This research analyzes spatial and temporal patterns of erosion and accretion. The study also correlates shoreline dynamics with environmental and anthropogenic factors. The PDF file containing maps, graphs, datasets and the full report is presented here.
